# debATEE
debate [chrome] extension!! made by ben!

## Features
* Automatically finds [archive](https://archive.today) links to bypass paywalls fast.
* Finds author/date/title and automatically compiles them into a card header
* Cuts cards, highlighting selected text and adding context in front and behind (usually works, in some cases it'll act weird)
* Lets you set your initials to add to end of card header
* Includes option to copy the formatted card and open a google doc (separate buttons!)
    * I wanted to make this automatically paste in the google doc but google docs is very weird :(
